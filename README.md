camSplit Board
==============

The camSplit board is the heart of the [MUX-4 4-Way Isolated Camera Splitter](http://dynamicperception.com/products/mux-4-camera-splitter) sold by Dynamic Perception LLC.

Not limited to controlling cameras, the camSplit provides a safe, and isolated way to multiply any two trigger outputs out to four separate devices, even if those devices have wildly different voltages (from 1.5V to 80V DC).  True optical isolation on every port means that different devices can safely react to the same control signal - allowing you to synchronize lights, cameras, and more.

Key Features 
------------

- Complete optical isolation between all cameras and control inputs 
- Can work with isolated intervalometer outputs (like the MX2) 
- Runs on 2x AAA batteries, will last many months between changes 
- Manual triggering of the shutter/focus lines via pushbuttons 
- Can be daisy-chained (feed one output to the input of another)
